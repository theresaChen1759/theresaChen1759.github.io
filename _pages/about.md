Hi, I'm Theresa! I'm a 3rd year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Minnesota working in the [Knowledge Computing Lab](https://knowledge-computing.github.io/) with Professor Yao-Yi Chiang. 

# Research Interests

- Machine learning for spatial problems and geographic data. Specifically, my background is in computer vision and adapting computer vision problems to better address challenges unique to geographic data. In particular I am interested in multimodal learning, geographic foundation models, and location-aware vision modeling. 

- Using state-of-the-art deep learning models for environmental applications (see ongoing projects). I believe machine learning models can lead to stronger predictive models in applications such as climate modeling, air quality modeling, wildfire movement, and disaster prediction. I always enjoy reading climate science and ecology papers related or unrelated to deep learning (and am always happy to discuss and open to colllaboration, so please feel free to email me if you have thoughts/things to discuss as well!)

- Self-supervised learning and multimodal learning in computer vision.
